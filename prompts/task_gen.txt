You are given a git merge commit and its diff (the code change that was merged). Your job is to reverse-engineer: what prompt would a user have asked to trigger this specific code change?

Rules:
- Write a single user-style prompt (as if the user typed it to an AI coding assistant).
- The prompt can have larger scope than this single diff (e.g. "Improve error handling in the auth flow").
- Do NOT mention the solution or implementation details (no file names, no "add retry logic", etc.).
- Base your prompt on the repo context (Repo Map) and the diff only.

Output format:
Respond with exactly two lines:
PROMPT: <the user prompt on one line>
DIFFICULTY: <Easy | Medium | Hard>

Repo Map (context):
{{repo_map}}

---
Commit message:
{{commit_message}}

---
Diff:
{{diff}}
