You are evaluating whether an AI-generated plan achieves the same goal as the ground truth solution (the actual code change from a merge).

User task: {{task_prompt}}

Ground truth (what was actually changed):
- Files modified: {{files_modified}}
- Files created: {{files_created}}
- Key additions: {{key_additions}}
- Libraries added: {{libraries_added}}

Ground truth commit message (actual merge): {{commit_message}}

Relevant diff/code context (actual merge diff): {{diff_summary}}

AI Plan:
{{plan}}

Question: Does the AI plan achieve the same goal as the ground truth? Is it a valid alternative, or does it over-engineer or miss the goal?
Respond with a single line: GRADE: <1-5> where 1=misses goal, 3=same goal, 5=equivalent or valid alternative. Then one short sentence justification.
