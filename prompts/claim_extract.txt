Parse the following plan (markdown) into atomic steps. For each step, extract:
1. Intent (what the step aims to do)
2. Verifiable claims: any statement about library existence, function/API syntax, or architectural constraints that can be checked against documentation or the codebase.

Output valid JSON only, no markdown code fence, in this shape:
{"steps": [{"intent": "...", "claims": ["claim1", "claim2"]}, ...]}

Plan:
{{plan}}
