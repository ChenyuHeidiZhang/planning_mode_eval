Evaluate the following plan's text quality on four dimensions (each 1-5). Output exactly 4 lines:

CONCISENESS: <1-5>  (information density; low fluff; avoid "In order to...", "It is important to note...")
PRECISION: <1-5>    (specific terminology over vague; e.g. "refactor Auth class" not "fix the thing")
TONE: <1-5>         (professional, action-oriented; "Implement X" not "We could try to...")
FORMATTING: <1-5>   (use of markdown, bullets, code blocks for readability)

Plan:
