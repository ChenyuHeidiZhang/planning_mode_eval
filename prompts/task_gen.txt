You are given a git merge commit and its diff (the code change that was merged). Your job is to reverse-engineer: what prompt would a user have asked to trigger this specific code change? If it is unclear from the commit messages, try your best to guess / make up a task that would involve changing the files in the diff.

Rules:
- Write a user-style prompt as if the user typed it to an AI coding agent.
- The prompt's task should be suitable for the AI agent's **"plan mode"**, i.e. the agent would write a plan for it before implementation (e.g. "Improve error handling in the auth flow").
- Base your prompt on the repo context (Repo Map) and the diff. The prompt should trigger the changes in the diff.
- Do NOT mention the solution or implementation details (no file names, no "add retry logic", etc.).

Output format:
Respond with exactly two lines:
PROMPT: <the user prompt on one line>
DIFFICULTY: <Easy | Medium | Hard>

Repo Map (context):
{{repo_map}}

Commit message:
